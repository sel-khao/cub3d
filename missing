Missing Validations

Configuration elements validation:

Validate texture file paths exist and are .xpm files


RGB parsing improvements:

Validate no negative signs in input

Map validation:

Flood fill algorithm to check map is properly closed (spaces adjacent to walkable areas)
Check map is rectangular or handle jagged edges with spaces
Validate minimum map size (3x3)
Check for holes in walls

Edge cases:

Empty lines between config and map
Tabs vs spaces handling
Multiple players check (you have it but no error message)
Player on edge of map
Map with only walls
