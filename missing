Missing Validations

Configuration elements validation:

Check that all 6 elements exist (NO, SO, WE, EA, F, C)
Check for duplicate elements
Validate texture file paths exist and are .xpm files


RGB parsing improvements:

Check for extra whitespace/characters after RGB values
Validate no negative signs in input
Better error messages


Map validation:

Flood fill algorithm to check map is properly closed (spaces adjacent to walkable areas)
Check map is rectangular or handle jagged edges with spaces
Validate minimum map size (3x3)
Check for holes in walls


Error handling:

Memory leak in configure() if parsing fails mid-way
No cleanup on error returns in main()
Missing error messages for specific failures


Edge cases:

Empty lines between config and map
Tabs vs spaces handling
Multiple players check (you have it but no error message)
Player on edge of map
Map with only walls
